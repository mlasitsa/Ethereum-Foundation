# Using AI for Real-World Solutions: Chatbots and Blockchain

One of my projects was building an AI chatbot using **Azure OpenAI Service**. It was made to help employees with tasks like answering common questions and fetching real-time data. The chatbot was integrated into **Microsoft Teams** and used **GPT-based models** fine-tuned with internal FAQs and documents to understand company-specific language. A big challenge was ensuring data security, which I solved using Azure's **role-based access controls**.

This experience showed me how **AI can automate tasks and give predictions**. It made me think about how AI could work with **blockchain**. I’m now trying to build a **crypto arbitrage bot** to find price differences across exchanges and automate trades. Another idea is to use an AI chatbot with blockchain data to suggest trading strategies—like when to go **short** or **long**, what leverage to use, and where to set **take-profit** or **stop-loss**.

AI and blockchain together can solve many problems. Projects like these show how AI can be useful in automation and decision-making, and I want to explore more ways they can work together
